<H2>BUGBOX Mathematical Modeling Simulations</H2>

BUGBOX software is for inquiry-based learning of mathematical modeling for population dynamics.  The software creates a virtual laboratory space inhabited by virtual insects.  Students conduct experiments and devise mathematical models to predict the experiment results.  

<br><br>
In <a href="BUGBOX/BUGBOX-predator-original.nlogo"><strong>BUGBOX-predator-original</strong></a>, students do experiments to find a relationship between prey density and consumption by one predator.  The program is a virtual adaptation of the human simulation described in a classic 1959 paper by C. S. Holling. [Netlogo version posted on 2022/07/16.]
<br><br>
In <a href="BUGBOX/BUGBOX-population.nlogo"><strong>BUGBOX-population</strong></a>, students observe the changes in the insect population to discover aspects of the insects' life cycle.  They can construct a simple linear difference equation model, using their observations to estimate the parameter values.  Four different scenarios give a sequence of increasing complexity.

<P>
Everyone is welcome to use BUGBOX for their courses. I would just appreciate an <A

<p>
BUGBOX-predator was originally written in python 2, with extensive use of the pygame and pgu packages, and converted into an executable using py2exe.

BUGBOX-population was originally written in python 3, with the built-in tkinter GUI package, and converted into a windows executable using cx_Freeze.

<A href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">Netlogo</A> has become the standard software for agent-based modeling such as is required for the BUGBOX software.  There is extensive documentation on-line.  People interested in writing agent-based models in Netlogo should also consult <em>Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling</em>, 2nd edition, by Steven F. Railsback and Volker Grimm.
