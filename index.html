I am now a self-funded postdoc (ie, an emeritus professor) and have moved to Denver Colorado.  I check email regularly and am still active in scholarship.

<HR>
<P>

Feel free to use any of my materials for courses at other schools. I would
appreciate being informed about which of my materials have been used where.

<H2><em>Mathematical Modeling for Epidemiology and Ecology</em></H2>
<p>
My new book, <A href="http://www.springer.com/
978-1-4614-7275-9"><em>Mathematical Modeling for Epidemiology and Ecology</em></A>, was published by Springer-Verlag in April 2023.  
<p>
Supplementary materials include <A href="https://www.math.unl.edu/~gledder1/Programs.zip">programs</A> and <A href="https://www.math.unl.edu/~gledder1/DataFiles.zip">data files</A>.  
<p>
I've also given two talks about the book: one <A href="SIMIODE_23_1.pdf">general talk</A> and a description of one of the <A href="SIMIODE_23_2.pdf">pedagogical features</A>.

<H2>Talks</H2>

I have given a large number of expository and pedagogical talks.  I've also posted some recent research talks in mathematical biology.

<H2>Mathematical Biology Research Papers</H2>
</A>
My recent research work has been in mathematical ecology, population dynamics, epidemiology, plant physiology, and plant life history theory.  I also have some pedagogical papers.

<A href="https://www.math.unl.edu/~gledder1/BUGBOX/">
<H2>BUGBOX Mathematical Modeling Simulations</H2></A>

BUGBOX software is designed for inquiry-based learning of mathematical modeling for population dynamics.  The software creates a virtual laboratory space inhabited by virtual insects.  Students conduct experiments and devise mathematical models to predict the experiment results.
<br><br>
In <strong>BUGBOX_predator</strong>, students do experiments to find a relationship between prey density and consumption by one predator.
<br><br>
In <strong>BUGBOX_population</strong>, students observe the changes in the insect population to discover aspects of the insects' life cycle.  They can construct a simple linear difference equation model, using their observations to estimate the parameter values.  Four different scenarios give a sequence of increasing complexity.

<H2>Large Print macros for LaTeX</H2>
</A>

It is somewhat tricky to produce a large print version of a LaTeX document for visually-impaired students. I have worked out a general scheme that allows me to quickly convert documents to large print.
